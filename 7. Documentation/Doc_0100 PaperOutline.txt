Team Toolset:
The project is deployed in R. Due to the small data size MS Excel proves being sufficient for some analysis.

Business Understanding
Who: Retail Business
What: The effects of the promotions of compeditors on the volume of sales. Understanding the promotion effects on the demand of goods as well as the cannibalization when a new product appears
by the same produsor.

Data Understanding
Creating Dummy Varaibles
Ploting variables against each other
Exploratory Data Analysis, finding outliers in the dataset.

Visualization Output
Chart 1 Ploloting the volume of sales agains the weeks, it is devided by the different types of promotions. There is a lot of variation.
Chart 2 Ploting the actual price against the weeks, it is devided by the different types of promotions. Usually the price variation is less then 20%
case A and E are exceptions.
Chart 3 Ploting the volume of sales against the weeks, it is devided by the different types of promotions. A type of promotion is having the highest volumes.
Chart 4 Ploting the actual price against the weeks, it is devided by the different types of promotions. A type is having the lowest prices.
Chart 5 Ploting the volume of sales against the weeks, it is devided by the different types of promotions.
Chart 6 Ploting the dummy variavle BaseSales against the weeks, the latest weeks have the highest baselines.
Chart 7 Ploting the dummy variavle SalesYearPast against the weeks, the situation is similar to that of Chart 6.

Note 1 the Chart numbering in github is not the same as here. Here the sourced code is being followed on the numbering.
Note 2 The legend of charts 6-8 the name of the color does not match with the true colors. 

Data Preparation
1. Raw Data:
Dataset 1--> Data Type: Sales --> Data Format: CSV
Dataset 2--> Data Type: Manipolated Data Sales (D_0010 DU_0100 BaseManipulations.csv) --> Data Format: CSV (dummy variables have been added to the intial dataset) for the compeditors.
Dataset 3--> Data Type: (D_0020 BasePriceCalculation.csv) --> Data Format: CSV

Modeling
We have created a model based on the D_0020 BasePriceCalculation.csv and the results are presented in M_0101 Result.txt.
Step 1. The Logarithmic function is used to transform the used data.
Step 2. The Mutate function is being used to transform the different types of promotions to quantitative values.
Step 3. The NA values are replaced with 0.
Step 4. The differences between the actual price and the compeditor price is calculated.
Step 5. Model output:
We calculate the predicted demand of the products based of the actual price, compeditors prices and price difference between the actual and that of the compeditors.
The PriceEffect, CompRet1, compRet2, inProm, timeInProm, priceDiff1, priceDiff3, priceDiff6, priceDiff7 are statistically significant in line
with their respective p-values, when they are less then 0.05.
Coefficients:
lm(formula = Upsale ~ priceEffect + compRet1 + compRet2 + compRet6 + 
    inProm + timeInProm + priceDiff1 + priceDiff3 + priceDiff6 + 
    priceDiff7, data = dataForModelling)

Deployment
If this has more data especially for the compeditors it could make for a better use of an application that predicts the fluctuations of the volume of sales based on the imput prices.
The current amount of data makes in not very usefull for any practical applications.
